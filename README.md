# qb-adminmenu

I added some functions to the adminmenu to print vector3/vector2 and other data to make it easy to configure other scripts' config.

## How to use it?

First, you have to type **/admin** and then go to **Developer Options**.
You have to see the **Print Dev Menu** button there, make it enabled, and press **INSERT** on your keyboard.
After that, you can switch between modes by pressing the **right mouse button** and can print the data by pressing the **left mouse button**.

The current mode you are in can be seen at the top of the screen.

Printed data will be in `resources/data.txt`

# Controls

```
